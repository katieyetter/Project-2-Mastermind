For those of you that enjoy strategy games, you've come to the right place! "Mastermind" was a game orignally created in 1972 for two-players.
Essentially, Mastermind is  a code-breaking game using different colored pegs on a board.  
One player chooses a particular order for the colored pegs without telling player 2.
Player 2 must guess the color of the pegs in the correct order in order to win the game!

In our version of MasterMind, you will be playing against the computer!
The computer has been coded to generate a random array of 4 colored "pegs." Your job is to correctly guess the colors of the pegs and the correct order!

You will have 10 attempts to guess and the computer will notify you of your correct and incorrect answers. In doing so, it will keep score of how many 
attempts you have used, as well as what pegs you have guessed correctly. 

To play, type the color you would like to guess: y = yellow, g = green, b = blue, and r = red and hit enter after each color. If the correct colors show up on the board, press 'c' and enter; if not press 'n' and enter and you can re-type the colors for that round. To play, run the game_code script.

Enjoy the strategic world of MasterMind!
